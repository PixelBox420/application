This is a tool for automatically applying to both Hoas and AYY campus housing applications in one ultra-short/fast/simple form for the Aalto campus.  
Many files are excluded from here. Code is an earlier, less refined, and less advanced version than was used in production.  
The code uses two servers: one interfaces with the user, and another interfaces with the application pages. (Won't work out of the box as they have changed their pages.)  
Production powered by: hot dogs, energy drinks, and 120-hour work weeks clocked on a timer.
